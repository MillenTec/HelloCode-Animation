This is an MG animation created using `After Effects`, which connects various programming languages and IDEs through the clue of **"Hello World"**. It is made to celebrate this special day for developers on October 24th, in honor of every programmer who loves coding.

## 1. Project Overview
I am a beginner with After Effects, learning AE knowledge while making open-source projects. This is my second AE work, and I would appreciate your guidance from more experienced peers.

My understanding of MG animation (and the reason for learning After Effects) was greatly influenced by Apple's famous MG animation: **"Wonderful Tools"** (you can watch it on [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1MJ411A77x)). So — perhaps you may notice some similar scenes in my animation to "Wonderful Tools."

As the 2025 October 24th Programmer's Day approaches, I wanted to make such an animation to celebrate this day, and that’s how this project came about.

In fact, the time for this animation was quite tight. My production time was roughly four full days, so there are still many details that aren't perfect. I may revise them later — you can see more in the following text; the rendering of this animation took over three hours...
